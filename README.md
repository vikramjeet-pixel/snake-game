# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls or itself.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the Snake game. The snake moves around a 20x20 grid, eating food to increase its length and score. The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with itself. Players can start or restart the game with a button and control the snake using arrow keys.

### Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Snake moves continuously, growing when it eats food.
- **Score Tracking**: Earn 10 points for each piece of food eaten.
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends on wall or self-collision.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use arrow keys to change direction (prevents reversing directly).
- **Visual Feedback**: Distinct colors for snake, food, and grid.
- **Restart Option**: Reset the game at any time with a button.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game grid, snake, and food.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and animation loop.
- **CSS**: Minimal styling (assumed to be in a separate `styles.css` file, not provided).
